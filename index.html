        <p>In 2017 I went on a day trip from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon.
                I rode on a bus that took about 4 hours to get to the Canyon,
                so we only had a brief amount of time at each "Canyon Stop".
                One of those stops featured a famous ice cream shop right on
                the edge of the canyon, but the line was so long that I didn't 
                have time to get any!! When I was back on the bus, the little
                girl who sat next to me had some.  Her parents, cousins,
                uncles, etc. were all sitting around us, licking their
                ice creams. I was kind of grossed out when I noticed the girl
                passing her cone around for each family memebr to get a licking
                from it.  Ew!  When I told her the ice cream looked good, and
                told her I didn't have any time to buy some, she shoved her
                cone towards me and asked, "Do you want some?"

        <h2>Icelandic Plane</h2>

        <p>I thought I had survived Iceland without an incident.
            I thought wrong.  The plane had just landed on American
            soil.  I stood up from my seat and started stretching.
            To my dismay, I saw an elderly man to my right picking
            his nose.  He didn't just pick his nose, though.  You
            could hear the liquids in his nose as he moved his
            finger around inside his nostrils.  He then proceeded
            to eat his bougers.  He did this about three or four
            times; just enough to make me almost vomit.  Think
            about this next time you have to touch one of those
            seatbelts in an airplane. ;)
